			<h1><em>What are National Parks?</em></h1>
			<h2>A national park is a piece of land set aside by the government for the protection of<br>
			the environment. A national park may be established for public pleasure and enjoyment, as <br>
			well as for historical or scientific reasons. In a national park, the majority of the landscapes,<br>
			as well as the plants and animals that inhabit them, are preserved in their natural state.<br>
			National parks in the United States and Canada are largely concerned with the protection of<br>
			both land and wildlife, whereas those in the United Kingdom are mostly concerned with the <br>
			protection of land, and those in Africa are primarily concerned with the conservation of animals.<br>
			Several other countries, like Brazil, Japan, India, and Australia, have vast regions set aside as national parks.<br>
